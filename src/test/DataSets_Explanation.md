# Data Generation Scripts Overview

This document provides an overview of the various data generation scripts included in this repository. These scripts are used to create synthetic data for different tables in the project, primarily for testing and demonstration purposes. Below is a description of each script and its specific purpose.

**Note:** Not all datasets generated by these scripts are currently used in the project. However, they are provided to demonstrate the depth and flexibility in creating diverse datasets that can be utilized for testing and other purposes.

## 1. `generate_csv_data.py`

### Purpose
This script generates a CSV file containing synthetic sales data. It is used to populate the **sales** table, which serves as the fact table in this project.

### Key Features
- Generates 500 rows of sales data.
- Each row includes information such as `customer_id`, `store_id`, `product_name`, `sales_date`, `sales_person_id`, `price`, `quantity`, and `total_cost`.
- Randomly selects values for each field to ensure variability in the dataset.

### Usage
This script is useful for creating a basic dataset to test sales data analysis and reporting functionalities.

## 2. `generate_Fake_customer_table_data.py`

### Purpose
This script generates SQL `INSERT` statements to populate the **customer** table with synthetic customer data.

### Key Features
- Uses the `Faker` library to create realistic customer information, such as names, addresses, and phone numbers.
- Generates a random joining date for each customer within a specified range.
- Outputs SQL `INSERT` statements directly to the console.

### Usage
This script is ideal for generating customer data to populate a database directly, helping to simulate real-world scenarios.

## 3. `extra_column_csv_generated.py`

### Purpose
This script creates a CSV file with an extra column for `payment_mode`, in addition to the standard sales data fields.

### Key Features
- Asks the user to input a specific date for which the data should be generated.
- Generates 1,000 rows of sales data with an added `payment_mode` column.
- The `payment_mode` can be either "cash" or "UPI", randomly assigned.

### Usage
This script is beneficial when testing features that require payment method data alongside standard sales data.

## 4. `generate_datewise_sales_data.py`

### Purpose
This script generates a large volume of sales data for a specific date provided by the user.

### Key Features
- User inputs the desired date for data generation.
- Produces 400,000 rows of sales data for the specified date.
- Includes standard sales data fields without any additional columns.

### Usage
This script is useful for performance testing and stress testing, as it generates a large dataset to evaluate the scalability of data processing and analysis workflows.

## 5. `less_column_csv_generated_data.py`

### Purpose
This script generates a CSV file with fewer columns than the standard sales data format, omitting some fields.

### Key Features
- Requires user input for the date of data generation.
- Creates 200 rows of data with fewer columns, focusing on a more limited set of information.
- Includes fields such as `customer_id`, `product_name`, `sales_date`, `sales_person_id`, `price`, `quantity`, `total_cost`, and `payment_mode`.

### Usage
This script is useful for testing scenarios where only a subset of the standard sales data is required or when working with minimal datasets.

This document should help you understand the purpose and usage of each data generation script in the repository, allowing for efficient testing and development of the project's functionalities. Although not all generated datasets are currently in use, these scripts showcase the ability to create diverse datasets for various testing and analytical needs.
